# [UE4] TheReality - Experience AR in VR

## What is this project about? 
This should be considered rather a simulation than a game, that I created with a bunch of other people for a university project. We all had no prior knowledge (or no significant) to game development. We all challenged us to learn what was behind the horizon for us. Some of us mastered their 3D Art skills, I personally get into C++ development. 
In this small demo simulation you will immerse through your HMD (we disgined this specifically on Oculus Rift with Touch Controller) into a world where the company called "TheReality" has changed the living of thounds of people by bringing the augmented reality glasses called "RealityOne". You have the pleasure to test the newest version of the glasses in their augmentation labs and you will be shown some of the features that come with these glasses. 

As the deadline for this project has come closer and closer you are likely to see not best practice stuff. We are going to clean our project to go with the best practices later on. For now it is working fine for us for presentational purposes.
You can find in this project a good library for VR interaction stuff, like to show hands in VR with finger movements and grabbing and climbing components, teleporting mechanism, FOV limiters, all these kind of stuff. Feel free to use it!

## Prerequisites 
If you want to build the game on your own you need to have: 
- Unreal Engine version 4.21.1 installed
- Visual Studio 
- Visual Studio extensions for game development in C++

## Minimum specs
To run the game smoothly we recommand at least a GTX 1060 (or higher) and a Intel i7-4790K with something around 12 GB of RAM installed.

## Where do I get a copy of that game?
